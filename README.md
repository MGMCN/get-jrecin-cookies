# get-jrecin-cookies
Get cookies for resource accesses authorized by jrec-in.

## Usage
```pop_email_address``` is the address where you receive the jrecin one-time code, and ```pop_email_password``` is the password for the email account that receives the jrecin one-time code. ```jrecin_address``` is your jrecin login address, and ```jrecin_password``` is your jrecin login password. It is recommended to use Outlook to receive the one-time code. If not using Outlook, you need to specify the address and port of the POP server(```pop_server„ÄÅpop_port```).
